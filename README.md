# thrown-away

Small script/webapp that allows users to input reddit usernames and find out what the total link/comment karma of those accounts is. The primary use case is if you had multiple throwaway accounts that had gotten significant karma from posts/comments and you were curious what your total karma would have been if you hadn't used a throwaway.

## improvements
* use [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)
* fix bug that retains karma from previous searches, forces you to reload the page
